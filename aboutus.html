    <h1>Brewery and Beer Finder (IPA API)</h1>
   <h2>Team Members</h2> <p>Raven Gates, Diego Garcia, Nick Haer, Nima Akhaveissy </p>
   <h2>Motivation:</h2> <p>Our goal is to make it easier to find beers that fit certain specifications, and to provide information, as well as linking to the breweries that serve beers meeting specifications.
   </p>
   <h2>Project Proposal:</h2> 
    <p> Brewery finder is a website dedicated to helping people find local breweries where they can drink the kinds of beer they like. It offers a form where users can input beer attributes they enjoy, and then locates breweries that have beers matching the description on a map. Clicking on the brewery lists the matching beers, with details for each individual beer and relevant stories/details, like price and rating. 
        Show breweries where beers that meet the search criteria are stocked
        Name, ratings and details for each beer
        Find more information about the beer, such as reviews, how the texture/taste is like, information on the crafting of the beer.
        Potential Additions: Information or functionality regarding either the beers, beer type, or breweries, along with tips on how to select successfully, or even suggesting related options from a beer that a user specifically selects as their favorite.
        </p>
        <p>Prospective Design:
                Form page, with input for specifications like abv( a range), type (IPA, stout, etc.), and price, along with a miles radius.
                After submitting, offers users a choice between map view and list view. 
                The list view has a list of breweries that have beers meeting specifications, along with their distance from your location. Clicking on these breweries will display a dropdown list of matching beers, with brief bios. Clicking on one will open up a longer, but still brief information section.
                The map view has a map of breweries. Clicking on one will open up the brewery and its beers to the right, where each beer has a short bio. Clicking on one will open up a more extensive bio, similar to with the list view.
                Potentially (Reach goal): A subscription section where users can subscribe to be sent information when a brewery in their radius updates their selection to include a beer that fits the users specifications.
                </p>
                
 <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

        <p> Google maps API, used to display the map, and markers on the map.
         Open Brewery API (possibly to discard). Used to find the breweries in Dallas, their lat/long coordinates, their website url, and other information.
         Google-places API business and times
         Plan to use Hover.css
        </p>

        <h2>Directions for Future Functionality:</h2>
               <p> Potentially (Reach goal): A subscription section where users can subscribe to be sent information when a brewery in their radius updates their selection to include a beer that fits the users specifications.
                Map view vs. list view for the breweries display, one using map markers and the other displaying a complete list of each matching brewery
                A more extensive information section, and more parameters, as well as more specific search terms.
                Shows recent searches in general of what people have searched for. </p>
