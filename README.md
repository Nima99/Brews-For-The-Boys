## Overview

This site is for all craft beer lovers in Dallas! Created with google maps api, and making use of a substantial amount of collected data, this app aims to help users find their favorite beers in Dallas and the breweries where you can find them. Simply answer three questions about the kinds of beer you like, and receive a list of all the craft breweries in Dallas that have beers that match your preferences. Then select the breweries you like best on an interactive map to see all the matching beers they carry.

## Challenges

This was our first major group project, and so presented several new challenges. Working with git and github was at first very difficult. Though we began to recognize the value of git later on, there was certainly a learning curve, which was at its steepest during this project. Other concerns involved working with dynamically created markers in google maps, and organizing all the data we had gathered in a way that interacted well with our js logic.

## Final-Thoughts

Though difficult, this project was also highly enjoyable, and the resulting app is quite fun to use. Through it, we learned how to use git, interact with a team of fellow developers, and how to make good use of significant amounts of data. All of these skills would prove to be highly beneficial in later projects as well.
